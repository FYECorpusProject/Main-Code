The '01EditDistFracBagsDraftAgainstFinalZdALLALL.png' shows the correlation
of the bag of words metric for draft sentences against final sentences, if
we run the alignment all the way to completion.

The x-axis is the quotient of the number of significant words in the
both draft and final sentences divided by the number of significant words
in the draft sentence.

The y-axis is the quotient of the number of significant words in the
both draft and final sentences divided by the number of significant words
in the final sentence.

The horizontal line at the top represents sentences for which all the
significant words in both draft and final sentences also appeared in
the draft sentence.

The vertical line at the right represents sentences for which all the
significant words in both draft and final sentences also appeared in
the final sentence.

CONCLUSION: We notice a correlation along a line of slope 1. These
dots would represent pairs of aligned sentences for which an equal
number of significant words were deleted from the draft sentence as
were inserted into the final sentence.
